    "首先，我们研究下将用于训练和评估管道的数据集。[LibriSpeech](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf) 是一个用英语朗读的大型语料库，用于训练和评估 ASR 模型。该数据集包含 1000 小时的有声读物语音内容。在此项目中，我们将使用一个小型子集，因为更大规模的数据需要更长的训练时间。但是，完成此项目后，如果你想深入了解这方面的知识，建议使用[在线](http://www.openslr.org/12/)提供的更多数据。\n",

    "- 如果你选择在模型中添加卷积层，使用**扩张卷积**可能会获得更好的结果。如果选择使用扩张卷积，确保能够在 `model.output_length` lambda 函数中准确计算声学模型的输出长度。你可以在 Google 的 [WaveNet 论文](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499)中详细了解扩张卷积。要查看利用扩张卷积的语音转文字系统示例，请参阅此 GitHub [代码库](https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet)。你可以[在 Keras](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) 中使用扩张卷积，但是在指定卷积层时需要特别注意 `padding` 参数。\n",
    "- 如果你的模型利用了卷积层，为何不添加**最大池化**层呢？请参阅[此论文](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02720.pdf)，了解在声学模型中利用最大池化层的示例架构。\n",

    "你在此代码库中指定的所有模型应该定义属性 `output_length`。此属性是一个 lambda 函数，可以将输入声学特征的（时序）长度映射到输出 softmax 层。此函数可以用于计算 CTC 损失；要查看这一点，请查看 `train_utils.py` 中的 `add_ctc_loss` 函数。要查看在代码中的什么位置定义模型的 `output_length` 属性，请查看 `sample_models.py` 文件。你将在大多数模型中注意到以下这行代码："
